# Bioinformatics: Gene Analysis
### By Niko Darby 

## Introduction

<p> This project will focus on analyzing different human genes from the Ensembl database. Various features will be extracted and scrutinized during this analysis including the Gene ID, HUGO symbol, genetic description, transcript count, the percentage of GC content, the status of the gene(s), and the phenotypic description. By extracting these various features, the genetic information will become immensely comprehensible. </p>
