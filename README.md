# Bioinformatics: Gene Analysis
### By Niko Darby 

## Introduction

<p> This project will focus on analyzing different human genes from the Ensembl database. Various features will be extracted and scrutinized during this analysis including the Gene ID, HUGO symbol, genetic description, transcript count, the percentage of GC content, the status of the gene(s), and the phenotypic description. By extracting these various features, the genetic information will become immensely comprehensible. </p>

<p> The feature of primary interest in this experiment is the GC percentage. The GC percentage will be examined per gene biotype to determine which biotype has the greatest GC intensity. As background GC content is deemed as the percentage of nitrogenous content that is classified as either guanine or cytosine in DNA or RNA. High GC contents have previously been confirmed to profusely affect gene functioning. </p> 

<p> Please enjoy the analysis and feel free to contact me if you have any questions at ndarby2050@Gmail.com. Thank you. </p>
